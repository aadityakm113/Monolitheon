        Even though this band is fairly new on the scene, the members of the band bring a lot of individual experience and skill to the band. Even with all our individual achievements with various other bands our friendship over the years has given us great chemistry which helps in our music and make our band sound really tight. We love composing our own songs and are looking to finish our first album soon.
